\begin{frame}{Post Quantum Cryptography}
Post Quantum Cryptography aims to provide QC-resistant cryptography
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shor's algorithm breaks RSA
    \item Quantum Cryptography is based on quantum phenomenons (quantum collapse, entanglement)
    \item actual experiments are shown that quantum cryptography can be used at very large scale 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Implementing Post Quantum Cryptography}
Things are quite simple, even simpler than classical ciphering
\begin{itemize}
    \item "flying qubits" (photons) are used to carry information between actors
    \item a superposed and entangled state is build, Alice and Bob each own half of it
    \item le first observer collapses the whose superposed and entangled state
    \item Because of quantum physics, Alice and Bob will observe the same result (or correlated result), Both know what
    the other one has observed. 
    \item Alice and Bob use that information to build a sgared secret
\end{itemize}
Once a shared secret is obtained, standard Cryptography algorithms are used. Very simple things, such as ciphering the 
message with a XOR operator are efficient. \newline \newline
If an intruder (Eve!) wants to do a MIM attack, it will have an impact that can be detected. It has been demonstrated
that its probably of staying invisible exponentially decreased with the number of involved qubits.
